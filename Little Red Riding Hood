**Scene 1:**

EXT. SMALL VILLAGE - DAY

We see LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD, a young girl with a vibrant red hood, standing in front of a cozy cottage. Her MOTHER hands her a basket filled with custard and butter.

MOTHER
Remember, Little Red, be careful and make sure to stay on the path.

Little Red Riding-Hood nods eagerly and skips off into the forest.

**Scene 2:**

EXT. THE FOREST - DAY

Little Red Riding-Hood wanders through the forest, humming a tune, when she encounters the WOLF. The Wolf, sly and cunning, approaches her with a friendly smile.

WOLF
Hello there, little girl. Where are you headed with such delicious treats?

Innocently, Little Red Riding-Hood shares her destination, not realizing Wolf's true intentions. The Wolf devises a plan to reach the grandmother's house before her.

**Scene 3:**

INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Wolf arrives at the Grandmother's house, sneaking in and devouring the grandmother. He then takes her place in bed, waiting for Little Red Riding-Hood to arrive.

**Act 2: The Encounter**

**Scene 4:**

INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Little Red Riding-Hood knocks on the door of the Grandmother's house, entering cautiously. She notices the difference in appearance but is deceived by the Wolf pretending to be her grandmother.

LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD
Grandmother, what big ears you have!

WOLF (as the grandmother)
All the better to hear you with, my dear.

Little Red Riding-Hood is lulled into a false sense of security.

**Scene 5:**

INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

As Little Red Riding-Hood approaches the bed to give her grandmother a kiss, the Wolf reveals his true identity, leaping out of bed and snarling at her. Little Red Riding-Hood's eyes widen in terror as the Wolf devours her.

**Act 3: Conclusion**

**Scene 6:**

INT. GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

The story concludes with no one left to intervene. The Wolf has successfully devoured Little Red Riding-Hood, his hunger satisfied.

FADE OUT.

**THE END.**
