Nav.AI is PDF to Screenplay Converter

This Python script converts a PDF document into a detailed screenplay using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model. The script processes the PDF in chunks, arranges the text into Acts and Scenes, and generates a formatted screenplay with dialogue, adhering to standard screenplay conventions.

Features

Read PDF: Extracts text from a PDF file.
Chunk Processing: Splits the text into chunks of 2000 words.
Acts and Scenes: Arranges the text into Acts and Scenes.
Screenplay Conversion: Converts each Act into a 1000-word screenplay with dialogue.
File Management: Saves each Act as a separate file and combines them into a final screenplay.
Standard Screenplay Format: Ensures the final screenplay adheres to standard formatting rules.
Prerequisites

Python 3.6+
OpenAI API key
Required Python packages: openai, PyPDF2
Installation

Download main.py and save it to a new folder:

Install requriements: 
bash
Copy code
pip install openai PyPDF2
Usage

Ensure your PDF file is named a.pdf and located in the same directory as the script.

Open main.py and replace "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will process the PDF, generate a screenplay, and save it as output.txt.

How It Works

Read PDF: The script reads the content of a.pdf and extracts the text.
Split Text: The extracted text is split into chunks of 2000 words to adhere to token limits.
Process Chunks: Each chunk is processed to create a detailed scene list and formatted into Acts and Scenes.
Generate Screenplay: Each Act is converted into a 1000-word screenplay with dialogue, saved as separate files (act1_scene1.txt, act1_scene2.txt, etc.).
Combine Files: All individual files are combined into a single screenplay file, output.txt.
Example Output

The final screenplay will be saved as output.txt in the same directory as the script. Each Act and Scene will be formatted according to standard screenplay conventions.
